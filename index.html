                                        </h3>
                                        <p>VIDEO The Vex Robotics 2022-2023 game comprises of disks that must be shot
                                            into elevated baskets to earn points. In one game mode, the robot skills
                                            challenge, a team has one minute to score as many points as possible with
                                            their driver or autonomous code. Since there's so little time to reach each
                                            disk and shoot it into the basket, we must strive to find the route that
                                            reaches the most disks possible (ideally all) in the least amount of time
                                            possible.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The question then becomes in what <i>order</i> is it best to visit all of the
                                            scoring game elements, so that we can save time.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>The Travelling Salesman:</h3>
                                        <p>Suppose that you are a traveler in the United States. You may want to visit
                                            all
                                            the big cities as cost-effectively as possible and then ultimately return to
                                            your home city. While traveling, it doesn’t make sense to return to any
                                            previous
                                            towns you’ve visited.</p>
                                        <p>This is an example of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), where, the goal
                                            is to navigate to each node only once, then return to the original node as
                                            efficiently as possible.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>While it’s simple to understand, it’s one of the most difficult problems in
                                            computer science to solve.
                                        </p>
                                        <center>
                                            <img src="images/geneticAlgorithm/image6.png" alt="" width="400">

                                        </center>

                                        <p>If you wanted a definite solution to this problem, the only way is to
                                            generate every possible order of cities there are, then test each order.
                                            This method may sound good, but the number of permutations to check is equal
                                            to the
                                            factorial of the number of nodes you have, so going from a 4-node network to
                                            a 5-node network is 5 times the values to check. For this reason,
                                            calculating the optimal path for even 20 nodes is impractical. The problem
                                            is classified as an NP-Hard problem, meaning you can’t determine its
                                            solution in polynomial time.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Hamiltonian Cycles & Path:
                                        </h3>
                                        <p>In graph theory, a Hamiltonian path is a route through a graph in which the
                                            route visits each node exactly once. This is different from a hamiltonian
                                            cycle, which visits each node once but returns to its original start node,
                                            completing a circuit uniting all the nodes together.

                                        <p>This will create a new generation of solutions, then this new generation
                                            would be used to create the next generation, and so on.

                                        <h3>Implementation</h3>
                                        <p>First, we want to create a way to represent a solution. In our case, we want
                                            to optimize for the shortest distance, so it would be helpful to have the
                                            VEX GPS coordinates of all the game scoring elements.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Below is a list, and for every stack of disks and roller, the GPS coordinates
                                            are recorded in a python tuple. This is analogous to a list of the GPS
                                            coordinates
                                            of every city you want to travel to.
                                        </p>

                                        </center>
                                        <p>Second, we want a way to represent a solution. Since we want to visit all of
                                            the
                                            points, all of these points are present in the solution. The only thing that
                                            differs
                                            from solution to solution is the order in which these points are
                                            placed.
                                        </p>

                                        </center>
                                        <p>From these paths, we want to pick four random solutions and take
                                            the best two solutions.
                                            Before we can do this, we need a way to evaluate how effective a
                                            particular solution is. In our case, we want to know the Hamiltonian length
                                            in terms of distance. This is just the cumulative sum of distances, just
                                            like evaluating the length of path between multiple cities.
                                        </p>

                                        </center>
                                        <p>Next, we want to merge these two parent solutions to create a new solution.
                                            This is called crossover, and there are quite a few ways to do it. If you’ll
                                            like to read how this process works please look at the crossover section
                                            below. Here, we combine the paths of two parents to make a new simular path,
                                            then mutate the child 1% of the time.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Finally, do this enough times to create an entirely new generation, then use
                                            that generation as the parent generation for the next!

                                        <h3>Genetic Crossover</h3>
                                        <p>There are several different ways to do a genetic crossover, and it largely
                                            depends on the problem you are trying to solve.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The easiest method of crossover is to do a 1-point crossover, which splits
                                            the genome of the 2 parents' genomes, swaps their parts then join the
                                            sequences together.
                                        </p>

                                        </center>
                                        <p>This is the easiest to code and works just fine in most applications.
                                            However, in this case, it
                                            won’t work, since we need to preserve that each location appears once in the
                                            solution. We’re aiming to change the order. Consider this example:

                                        <p>While these are effective (and optimal?) routes, the route assumes that the
                                            driver is shooting disks as they go, so they won’t break the 3 disk storage
                                            limit. In the real world, a driver may need to deviate to get closer to the
                                            goal to score effectively.

                                        <p>One way of planning these excursions is to implement them into the
                                            generation. For example, I could modify the scoring mechanic so that for
                                            each 3rd disk the solution has and if the current location is outside of
                                            shooting distance, then add the distance to the shooting zone and then back
                                            to the running total.

                                        </h3>
                                        <p>Imagine you’re a baseball pitcher practicing your throws. Like all baseball
                                            pitchers, your goal is to throw a baseball at the correct angle so that it
                                            hits the catcher's glove. You throw your first baseball, and it goes too
                                            high. You take a mental note of the angle you’ve thrown the ball at, and how
                                            far the baseball has gone above the catcher. This time, you throw the ball
                                            lower. The baseball sails much closer to the pitcher but is too low. Since
                                            you’re closer to the target, you adjust slightly more upwards, throwing the
                                            baseball, and you nail the throw.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>Gradient Descent
                                        </h3>
                                        <p>Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that refines variables like
                                            these and is arguably the most fundamental procedure in machine learning.
                                            Like the pitcher example, gradient descent takes a guess, calculates whether
                                            it’s too high or low relative to the target, and refines its guess. Gradient
                                            descent can optimize many different variables simultaneously, as long as you
                                            can quantify how far off each metric was.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Returning to the pitcher example, imagine if the arc was the path of the
                                            ball, and the dot is the target.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>Gradient descent first says to find the error in the system. If the target is
                                            4 meters away, we simply subtract the position of the ball (y(4) feet high)
                                            from the target (4 feet).
                                        </p>
                                        MATH
                                        <p>This is where our algorithm diverges from the simple example. The simplest
                                            way to adjust the throw is proportional to the negative error. If you throw
                                            the ball 1 foot too high, you aim 1 degree lower, if you throw the ball a
                                            half foot too low, you aim half a degree up. It doesn’t need to be 1-to-1
                                            adjustments, but just some proportionality constant.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            The issue with this is it doesn’t work for all cases, imagine if we were
                                            trying to adjust the a constant in our equation or if it was a cubic or
                                            square root. The step sizes would be disproportionate to what we’re
                                            changing, which is why we take the derivative.

                                        </p>
                                        <p>In machine learning, the most common loss function is squared error.

                                        <p>In our case it’s easier to quantify the effectiveness of the algorithm using
                                            this squared error, since if a robot were to overshoot then undershoot, the
                                            error would always stay above 0, a lower squared error would always mean
                                            better performance overall.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>To understand how we should affect our system now, we take the derivative of
                                            the error with respect to the result.

                                        <h3>Applying to Robotics</h3>
                                        <p>When using a PID controller to control turns, the wheels practically start
                                            spinning in reverse at some point during the turn to stop as fast as
                                            possible. This however is difficult to control, and takes fine tuning of
                                            algorithm constants to get right.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>If you were to graph a poorly tuned PID turn, it would look something like
                                            this:
                                        </p>

                                        <p>The y-axis represents the robots nominal error (error between target and
                                            current heading, so an error of 0 would be perfect). The x-axis represents
                                            the time since the turn was executed in milliseconds.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Since the robot had a negative nominal error on the interval 580, 640, it
                                            means the robot overshot the turn, went past where it was supposed to end
                                            before correcting itself.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The robot is programmed to not end the turn unless the derivative of the
                                            nominal error is 0.1. Meaning the robot’s rotation needs to be practically
                                            stationary. If we instead applied normal breaking power, the robot would
                                            continue to under or over shoot under it’s own momentum we allowed the robot
                                            to correct itself first.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>When we were brainstorming how we could quantify what a perfectly tuned turn
                                            would look like, we settled on looking at the local minimums. In this case,
                                            the local minimum is -12 degrees. Meaning, the robot has overshot 12 extra
                                            degrees past where it was supposed to stop.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The opposite can also be true, when the robot stops too early.
                                        </p>

                                        <p>This is a less extreme example with better tuning. However, the robot did
                                            stop too early and begin reversing it’s direction to compensate for it’s
                                            excess speed. The local minimum here is only 2 degrees, but in early ML
                                            training and without proper tuning this can again reach high into the double
                                            digits.

                                        <p>Well, the aim is to have no velocity at the angle which we’ve set it to turn
                                            to. Meaning, we want the local minimum to occer at 0.

                                        <p>On a graph, this would look like the motion blends seamlessly in with the

                                        <p>Loosely speaking, the Kp constant controls how fast the robot responds to the
                                            error overall. From our pitcher example, we said that if we’re 1 foot too
                                            high then we should aim 1 degree down. In this system, we multiply however
                                            far we were off by -1 to get how much we should adjust. Likewise, the Kp
                                            constant here causes the robot to adjust faster while it’s far from it’s
                                            target, and slow down when it’s close. It doesn’t make sense to change this
                                            constant however as changing this would change our movement speed overall,
                                            and we only want to control the last part of the term.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The Ki gain adjusts the robot in cases of really small errors. In a
                                            stand-alone PD controller without an integral part it’s difficult to adjust
                                            the robot at 1 degree, since our motors are only getting 0.5 volt of power
                                            if we had Kp=0.5, well, to overcome friction you may need more power then
                                            that, so the robot may not move. The integral part says is to compound the
                                            error over time. When compounding the error, the PID output would grow and
                                            grow, until the robot finally overcomes friction and moves.

                                        <p>Finally, the derivative gain responds to how fast the robot is approaching
                                            it’s target. It’s this part of the equation that dampens movement and acts
                                            as a brake. So it’s this part of the equation we should tune.

                                        <h3>Ziegler-Nichols Algorithm
                                        </h3>
                                        <p>There is a well known heuristic to calculate an initial set of PID constants
                                            called ziegler-nichols method. This algorithm is a heuristic and differs
                                            quite a bit from reality, however, it’s a good starting point for the
                                            mashine learning algorithms to start off from.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>First and foremost, you find Kcritical which is the Pd value where the robot
                                            consistently overshoots to both sides in a wave. This wave at Kcritical is
                                            neither growing in strength, nor deteriorating.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Second you measure the wave’s oscillating period represented with Tu.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>For our robot, Kcritical=-2.1 and Tu=0.31 which is 310 milliseconds.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Lastly you find the respective initial values on a look-up table, these
                                            values are laboratory tested across many different control systems. For now,
                                            we choose to use the Classic PID control type. Kp, Ki, Kd are the values we
                                            want to calculate.</p>

                                        <p>Now, we can match this to the pitcher example from before.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>When the robot has overshot it’s turn (if the local minimum is less 0) we can
                                            increase the Pd gain by some amount and when the robot underturns we can
                                            decrease the Pd gain.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>To do this as efficiently as possible and minimizing learning time, we follow
                                            the gradient decent algorithm.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>First and foremost, we execute a turn with no derivative gain and monitor for
                                            the local minimum.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Local minimums are defined as where the derivative of the motion switches
                                            from negative to positive. Here it is in code.

                                        <p>We’re only interested in the first local minimum after the robot begins it’s
                                            turn and none after, hence why we use a conditional to stop checking after
                                            the fact. We’re also interested in the value at the local minimum, so we
                                            store the nominal error.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Finally, we calculate the derivative of the squared error and refine our
                                            estimate of Kd.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>Our change to the initial guess shouldn’t be equal to the derivative,
                                            otherwise the robot’s learning would jump all over the place and would
                                            hardly refine itself. So we multiply the derivative by the learning rate.
                                            Too slow and the robot would hardly learn anything, and too fast and the
                                            robot may jump from making overly tuned turns to undertuned and jump back
                                            and forth. We found a learning rate of 0.3 works for us.

                                            attempts, rerunning this yielded the same result. I was not able to match

                                        <p>Finally here is a video of the robot learning on hard-wood floors. If you
                                            follow the placement of a corner, the robot hones in on making a more
                                            precise 90 degree turn. When the robot uses GPS instead of inertial there is
                                            no sliding.

                                        <p>Path following is an algorithm that keeps a vehicle traveling along a path.
                                            It is helpful to guide the robot to any desired point while maintaining a
                                            safe distance from extraneous disks and objects. In the video linked at the
                                            end of this document, a robot managed to avoid obstacles following a
                                            path.

                                        <p>We aim to draw any curved arc on a VEX field and then have a robot follow the
                                            curve. Since our robot was undergoing a redesign while I was working on
                                            this, we used VEX Codev5
                                            simulations and a dummy bot to develop this algorithm.
                                        </p>

                                        <p> First and foremost, the robot must know its current position and heading.
                                            Odometry and GPS are allowed in skills programming, but for simplicity in
                                            simulation, we used GPS.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> Now that the robot knows its current x, y, and angle, it looks ahead of
                                            itself forty centimeters, and this point is called the seek point.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> The seek point is analogous to the point you view when driving a car.
                                            Generally speaking, it’s not enough information to know the car's current
                                            position on the road. You must look ~15 seconds ahead of the car's position
                                            and drive to that point, which keeps you on track.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> The path the robot follows is simply an array of points.
                                        </p>

                                        <p> The next step for path following is to find the closest path point to the
                                            seek point. Just as you turn to the segment of the road point closest to ~15
                                            seconds away, the robot turns to the closest point on the path forty
                                            centimeters away. As the robot gets closer to this point, it must target a
                                            new one further away. This perpetual cycle is what gets the robot to follow
                                            a path.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            This step requires the help of another algorithm, the seek algorithm. For
                                            the robot to drive to these targeted points, it must have a procedure to
                                            drive to a single point.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> Essentially, the seek algorithm uses the robots x, y, and the targeted
                                            points x and y. With the help of a little trigonometry; the robot can
                                            calculate how many degrees left or right it must turn to face the targeted
                                            point. From here, the robot simply drives forward, always adjusting its
                                            course left and right. We will expand on this later in more detail.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> Finally, we get to the end of the path. The robot knows it’s at the end of
                                            the path because the targeted point is the last in the path array. The robot
                                            simply stops its movement then.

                                        <p>To work backward, the end goal is to call a path-following function, just
                                            like this:
                                        </p>

                                        <p> The PID class controls the robot's turn reaction to being off-target. The
                                            internal workings of PID are beyond the scope of this document, but in
                                            this context, these three values control the turn behavior. With the optimal
                                            values, the robot will turn quickly and not overshoot or undershoot. I have
                                            already written about finding the optimal PID values in the section: PID
                                            Optimization with Machine Learning.

                                        <p>To walk through the code, we set the look-ahead distance to forty centimeters
                                            (four hundred millimeters) and repeatedly drove to the target point on the
                                            path. If the targeted point wasn’t the last, then the robot stopped.

                                        <p>Each time the outer loop ran, a nested loop would go through all the path
                                            points and find the closest to the seek point.

                                        <p> One notable difference between the theory we discussed and the function is
                                            the accumulation of distances.

                                        <p> In the future, I plan to use machine learning to tune the PID controller
                                            just as I did for simple turns. The metric to grade the PID controller is
                                            the total distance the robot has spent from the line throughout a circuit
                                            loop, updating its PID values to minimize path offset.

                                        <p>There is a bug in the implementation shared. If all of the path points are
                                            further than 9.9 billion millimeters away (9,999 kilometers) from the seek
                                            point, then the robot will haphazardly target the first point, which may not
                                            be the closest.

                                        <p> The seek method calculates the relative angle to the target between the
                                            robot's current heading and the target. With a PID controller, the robot
                                            turns to face the target while driving forward. It's’ worth noting that the
                                            current_heading is = -GPS.heading() + 90 because VEX sets the y-axis on the
                                            GPS 0 heading. While doing trigonometry, the X-axis is always considered 0
                                            degrees, and the y-axis is considered 90. To make life simple, translated
                                            vex’s GPS units to standard unit circle units so that I will not need to do
                                            extraneous calculations in the trigonometry section.

                                        <p> Lines 22-29 simply handle edge cases, like: “what if the robot is on the
                                            target point?” and “what if the robot is on the same x-axis?” Doing
                                            computations without these checks would to a division of 0 error and cause
                                            problems.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> From 30 on, we simply compute the arctan of the angle (arctan tells us the
                                            angle, in radians of the ratio of the opposite to adjacent triangle legs).
                                        </p>
                                        <p> It’s not enough to simply do arctan. For example, consider if the robot was
                                            -100mm in the x direction and -100mm in the y direction from its target
                                            (which should be a 225-degree heading). That angle would be different than
                                            if the robot was 100mm in the x direction and 100mm in the y direction
                                            (traveling at a 45-degree heading), the two angles should be 180 degrees
                                            apart.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> Since arctan takes the ratio of the legs, both divide by 1, giving the same
                                            angle, 45 degrees. To deal with this, a reference angle must be added
                                            depending on the quadrant the robot is in relative to the targeted point. If
                                            the robot is in quadrants 1 and 4, 180 could be added. And for quadrants 2
                                            and 3, -180 needs to be added.
                                        </p>
                                        <p> Since this is the relative angle, it makes sense that if the robot was on
                                            the track it should return 0 degrees, and -180 if it makes a full rotation.
                                            To handle this, all degrees should be between -180 to 180 and appropriately
                                            scaled.

                                                to 180.

                                        <p>13% of all truck accidents occur as a result of sleep deprivation. 66% of all
                                            truck drivers fall asleep at the wheel, and 13% have stated they have fallen
                                            asleep at the wheel. This is not only detrimental to human lives, but also
                                            damages supply chains, which are currently very important in the
                                            post-pandemic economy.

                                        <p>A pulse sensor detects a driver's heart beat in bpm, and send that
                                            information to a server, which then directs it to a mobile application
                                            (cross-platform with React Native). The mobile application processes the
                                            heart rate, counting the driver's average heart rate and detecting
                                            significant changes that indicate the driver is falling asleep or other
                                            potential dangers. The app will then notify the driver with bright text and
                                            an alarm.

                                        </h3>
                                        <p>The heart sensor comes from a set of sensors (37 in 1 kit) which attaches to
                                            an Arduino Uno. The heart beat is measured up to 8 bits of accuracy, and
                                            each bit is individually sent to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi then sends
                                            that information out with an API to a React Native app, which first
                                            calibrates to determine the user's average heart rate, and then measures
                                            significant deviations which may indicate danger.

                                        <h3>Challenges we ran into
                                        </h3>
                                        <p>We tried to originally use the Raspberry Pi directly to listen to the user's
                                            heart rate, but it turned out that the Raspberry Pi did not support analog
                                            signal, and so we had to use an Arduino, which supports analog signal, then
                                            turn it into digital signal, and send the signal in 8 bits to the Raspberry
                                            Pi. We spent a majority of time trying to connect the Arduino with the
                                            Raspberry Pi. It took 6 hours to figure out that the two microcontrollers
                                            were connected to two different power sources, and that caused the signal to
                                            become noisy. While we were building the mobile application we resorted to
                                            using an API to emulate the heart rate until we got both working.

                                        <p>Recycling and composting is only effective when people have the motivation to
                                            do so- and it is largely evident that many people don't have that
                                            motivation. But competition is a very effective motivator, and when the
                                            requirements to compete are simple, people are further engaged. Therefore,
                                            we had the idea of creating a trashcan that not only slows down the
                                            generation of waste that goes into landfills, but also keeps people
                                            continuously engaged in the act of recycling and/or composting. We introduce
                                            the IntelliWaste.
                                        </p>
                                        <h3>What it does
                                        </h3>
                                        <p>The IntelliWaste itself is a trashcan cover that simply weighs the amount of
                                            trash inside of the trashcan that it is on. However, the real magic lies in
                                            the web server that the IntelliWaste sends its output to. The web server
                                            displays the current weight of the trash inside of the IntelliWaste's
                                            trashcan, and also contains a leaderboard displaying the IntelliWaste users
                                            with the lowest weight in their trashcan. In this way, we not only fuel
                                            competition for the lowest amount of landfill waste produced, but we also
                                            keep people engaged in keeping the world clean through their need to be at
                                            the top of the leaderboard.

                                        <h3>How we built it
                                        </h3>
                                        <p>We built the IntelliWaste (more specifically a prototype) using an ESP32
                                            microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensor determines
                                            how much waste is inside of the trashcan, and from that information we can
                                            roughly determine the weight of the waste as well. The microcontroller then
                                            sends a GET request to our web server, which updates the value of the trash
                                            weight for that IntelliWaste user. That information then gets sorted and
                                            displayed on the leaderboard, and is updated every refresh. The web server
                                            was built using Flask, and the users, as well as their corresponding trash
                                            weights, are stored in a database made with SQLite.

                                        <p>We originally wanted the IntelliWaste to be a simple scale; however, we did
                                            not have access to a piezoelectric sensor. We attempted to use one by taking
                                            apart a regular commercial scale, but those attempts failed, and we were
                                            left with about 16 hours left to complete the hackathon. It seemed dire, but
                                            we had an ultrasonic sensor left behind from a previous project, and we
                                            managed to substitute the scale with the sensor. We also had a problem when
                                            we realized we needed to provide a live demonstration of our project, as we
                                            did not think we would need to deploy the website. However, we managed to
                                            scrape with ngrok, although it is a bit of a rough fix.

                                        <p>We learned that commercial scales do not have viable piezoelectric sensors.
                                            However, at the same time, I think we had good review on both backend and
                                            frontend development- and the fact that the website is accessible is a nice
                                            lil' bonus on top.

                                        <p>All PID systems need 3 things, a feedback input, a system output, and some
                                            code to manipulate the output. In our case, the feedback input is used with
                                            a gyro from the VEX inertial sensor, the output is the voltage to the motors
                                            (one side spinning in reverse). While the program is running, I will specify
                                            a target heading, which would create an error difference in code,
                                            recalculating the motor voltages.</p>
                                        <p>The PID controller is tuned using 3 variables, (Kp, Ki, Kd) each change
                                            their corresponding equation to be more in tune, or out of tune. Lastly each
                                            of these equations has an input variable which is the error between where it
                                            is and the programmed target heading.</p>
                                        <h3>Proportional Control</h3>
                                        <p>Proportional control reacts only to how far the robot is away from it’s
                                            target.
                                            When it has a greater error, the robot will spin faster, when it has a lower
                                            error,
                                            the robot will spin slower. By itself, this is a poor control loop to use
                                            because
                                            the robot will always end in an oscillation between pointing left, than
                                            right. The
                                            second issue is that it only works for large errors, like when it’s +20
                                            degrees off,
                                            When the error is too small (i.e 2 degrees), the output will be too small
                                            and the
                                            robot won’t turn.</p>

                                        <h3>Integral Control</h3>
                                        <p>Integral control allows the robot to turn for very small angles. It does this
                                            by repeatably summing itself so the output of the equation is always
                                            growing,
                                            unless the error is 0. On the robot, this looks like the motors will keep
                                            speeding
                                            up any time the robot isn’t turning towards it’s target. For smaller angles,
                                            this
                                            works well, but for larger angles it has the issue of massively
                                            overshooting. The
                                            way we got around that is we set Ki (the variable to tune this equation) to
                                            0
                                            for any angle greater than 20 degrees, anything else and it’ll be 0.005.</p>

                                        <h3>Derivative Control</h3>
                                        <p>Derivative control reacts to the speed the robot is turning at, When just
                                            using
                                            proportional or integral control the robot will continue to overshoot
                                            because it’s
                                            not programmed to stop the turn comfortably. Derivative control by itself
                                            will
                                            stop any left right accelerations by spinning the wheels opposite to the
                                            direction
                                            the hit came from. The issue is this control doesn’t tell the robot to turn
                                            to a
                                            specific point, it just stops any unwanted rotation so it must be used with
                                            at
                                            least proportional control.</p>
